        <h2>Gaganyaan Mission</h2>
        <p id="missionDetails"> Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters.

            The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience of Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with cutting edge technologies available with international agencies. 
            The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying crew safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, c
            rew emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and rehabilitation of crew.</p>

        <h3>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Satellite</h3>
        <p>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory being jointly developed by NASA and ISRO. 
           NISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally consistent data for understanding 
           changes in Earthâ€™s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, ground water and natural hazards including 
           earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR. It carries L and S dual band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which 
           operates with Sweep SAR technique to achieve large swath with high resolution data. The SAR payloads mounted on Integrated 
           Radar Instrument Structure (IRIS) and the spacecraft bus are together called an observatory. Jet Propulsion Laboratories and 
           ISRO are realizing the observatory which shall not only meet the respective national needs but also will feed the science community 
           with data encouraging studies related to surface deformation measurements through repeat-pass InSAR technique.</p>
