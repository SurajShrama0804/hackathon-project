        <h2>Gaganyaan Mission</h2>
        <p id="missionDetails"> Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters.

            The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience of Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with cutting edge technologies available with international agencies. 
            The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying crew safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, c
            rew emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and rehabilitation of crew.</p>

        <center><figcaption>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR)</figcaption></center>
        <p>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory being jointly developed by NASA and ISRO. 
           NISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally consistent data for understanding 
           changes in Earth’s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, ground water and natural hazards including 
           earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR. It carries L and S dual band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which 
           operates with Sweep SAR technique to achieve large swath with high resolution data. The SAR payloads mounted on Integrated 
           Radar Instrument Structure (IRIS) and the spacecraft bus are together called an observatory. Jet Propulsion Laboratories and 
           ISRO are realizing the observatory which shall not only meet the respective national needs but also will feed the science community 
           with data encouraging studies related to surface deformation measurements through repeat-pass InSAR technique.</p>

        <h3>ISRO-DBT ink deal to conduct biotechnology experiments in space station: </h3>
        <center><img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/f29t94/article68797359.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI10_24_2024_000262B.jpg" alt="" width="300px" ></center>
        <center><figcaption>ISRO Chairman and Secretary, Department of Space S. Somanath</figcaption></center>
        <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) have inked an agreement to design and conduct experiments, which will then be integrated into the forthcoming Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), India’s proposed indigenous space station.

            The BAS is expected to take shape from 2028-2035.
            
            Some of the experiments being mooted include how weightlessness can influence muscle loss on those in space, what kind of algae may be suitable as nutrients or to preserve food for longer, how some algae may be processed to make jet fuel and the impact of radiation on the health of those aboard space stations.
            
            Before the BAS, the major mission on ISRO’s plate is the Gaganyaan mission, which will be India’s first crewed mission to space that is expected to launch in 2025-2026. Prior to that there will be three, uncrewed test missions. Some of the biology missions could be included in these test missions.
            
            “In some of the test flights (uncrewed) prior to the main Gaganyaan mission, we may consider including some of these experiments. Which ones specifically, we are yet to decide,” S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO, told The Hindu. “Based on what we learn, we could consider some experiments in Gaganyaan. However, the primary plan is for the BAS.”
            
            The International Space Station (ISS), which is a collaborative venture involving the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, has been operational, in its complete form, since 1998. But with changing geo-politics and costs, the ISS is expected to be decommissioned by 2030. Some countries are moving to build their own space stations. China launched the base module of its station, Tiangong, in 2021 and has complete the tri-modular station as of November 2022. The station hosts regular crewed missions.
            
            The ISRO-DBT collaboration stems from another initiative this year called the BIOE3 (Biotechnology for Economy, Environment and Employment) policy by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) that aims to stimulate ‘bio-manufacturing’ in India. The bio-economy, officials in the DBT said, would be worth $300 billion by 2030.
            
            “The space bio-manufacturing sector is part of this. This agreement will spur innovation and developments in human health research, novel pharmaceuticals, biotherapeutics, regenerative medicine, bio-based technologies for waste management as well as support multiple start-ups,” said Rajesh Gokhale, Secretary, DBT.</p>

            UN-OOSA notified India as the host country for establishment of Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP). The Centre was established in India on November 1, 1995 under an agreement signed initially by 10 member countries of the region. The Centre is hosted by the Government of India with Department of Space (DOS), as the nodal agency. DOS has made available appropriate facility and expertise to the Centre through the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), at Dehradun, Space Applications Centre (SAC), at Ahmedabad and Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), at Ahmedabad, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengaluru
            
            The educational programme of the Centre is oriented towards the dissemination of knowledge in relevant aspects of space science and technology. The centre offers post graduate level courses in the areas of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Satellite Communications, Satellite Meteorology and Global Climate, Space and Atmospheric Sciences. The details can be viewed here
            
            <h3>School Bhuvan - NCERT</h3>
            
            This is the portal that provides map based learning to bring awareness to the students about the country's natural resources, environment and their sustainable development.Click here to go the portal
            
            <h3>Student Satellite Programme</h3>
            
            ISRO has been encouraging student community to participate in ISRO missions and learn space technology as capacity building effort to prepare the future space scientists and technologists as well as to develop future vendors in this area, who can design develop, fabricate, test, space technology sub-systems and units for consumption within the country as well as to become competitors in the world market.
            
            Over the past few decades of ISRO's space programme several universities / academic institutions have participated in the space related programmes as well as technology development. As part of this, several institutions were interested in introducing education in the space technology and subsequently space sciences have taken initiative and designed student satellites as well as developed payloads. In order to coordinate all the activities related to space technology projects by students in the university, especially student satellites, ISRO has established a mechanism to streamline these activities in the form of small satellites as part of Indian remote sensing programme.
