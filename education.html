        <h2>Some More Resources For Students:</h2>
        <p>ISRO is committed to encourage students in creating awareness in the space technology and applications. They are the future hopes for applying technologies for social and economic up-liftment of the country. Several programmes are conceived for students to engage in STEM activities and learning.

            <h3><u>ISRO STEM Portal: </u></h3>
            
            ISRO offers the various activities for the interested students to engage in STEM activities connected to space science, technology, and application areas. The knowledge portal includes online certified courses, interactive video sessions with space scientists, provision to submit creative imaginations of space kids, virtual museum interface, Innovative ideas of students including Apps/ research papers, etc. and a space quiz for testing their awareness.
            
            The portal also hosts various knowledge videos, ISRO missions at Glance, Space dictionary etc.
            
            The portal can be accessed here
            
            <h3><u>YUVIKA</u>:</h3>
            
            YUva VIgyani KAryakram or "Young Scientist Programme" is a sponsored programme organised by ISRO for School Children to impart basic knowledge on Space Technology, Space Science and Space Applications to the younger students with a preference to rural areas. The programme is aimed at creating awareness about the emerging trends in science and technology amongst the youngsters, who are the future building blocks of our nation. ISRO has chalked out this programme to "Catch them young". The programme is also expected to encourage more students to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) based research /career.
            
            More details on YUVIKA are available here
            
            UNNATI (UNispace Nanosatellite Assembly & Training by ISRO)
            
            It is a training programme on nanosatellite assembly and building for foreign Students/ Engineers/ Scientists/ Officials. The training provides an opportunity for the participating countries to strengthen their capabilities in assembling, integrating, and testing nanosatellites.
            
            India announced this programme in 2018 in Vienna during the Symposium to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the First United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE+50). So far, 60 participants from 33 countries benefited from such 2 months residential programme. The programme is conducted at ISROâ€™s U.R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengaluru.
            
            For the announcements, the ISRO site and ISRO social media may be followed.
            
            <h2>IIRS, Dehradun- e-learning Programme</h2>
            
            Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), Dehradun is a premier institute primarily focussing on training for GeoSpatial applications. IIRS also conducts a distance learning program under the IIRS Outreach Programme which focuses on strengthening the Academia and User Segments in Space Technology & Its Applications using Online Learning Platforms. The program is being conducted through the following two modes
            
            1. Live and Interactive classroom sessions Click here for more details
            
            2. E-learning based online courses Click here for more details
            
            <h2>Educational Programmes by CSSTEAP</h2>
            
            UN-OOSA notified India as the host country for establishment of Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP). The Centre was established in India on November 1, 1995 under an agreement signed initially by 10 member countries of the region. The Centre is hosted by the Government of India with Department of Space (DOS), as the nodal agency. DOS has made available appropriate facility and expertise to the Centre through the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), at Dehradun, Space Applications Centre (SAC), at Ahmedabad and Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), at Ahmedabad, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengaluru
            
            The educational programme of the Centre is oriented towards the dissemination of knowledge in relevant aspects of space science and technology. The centre offers post graduate level courses in the areas of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Satellite Communications, Satellite Meteorology and Global Climate, Space and Atmospheric Sciences. The details can be viewed here
            
            <h2>School Bhuvan - NCERT</h2>
            
            This is the portal that provides map based learning to bring awareness to the students about the country's natural resources, environment and their sustainable development.Click here to go the portal
            
            <h2>Student Satellite Programme</h2>
            
            ISRO has been encouraging student community to participate in ISRO missions and learn space technology as capacity building effort to prepare the future space scientists and technologists as well as to develop future vendors in this area, who can design develop, fabricate, test, space technology sub-systems and units for consumption within the country as well as to become competitors in the world market.
            
            Over the past few decades of ISRO's space programme several universities / academic institutions have participated in the space related programmes as well as technology development. As part of this, several institutions were interested in introducing education in the space technology and subsequently space sciences have taken initiative and designed student satellites as well as developed payloads. In order to coordinate all the activities related to space technology projects by students in the university, especially student satellites, ISRO has established a mechanism to streamline these activities in the form of small satellites as part of Indian remote sensing programme.
            
            
            <h2>Facility Visits</h2>
            
            <h3>ISRO centres facilitates the technical visits to the ISRO facilities on selective days. The colleges need to write to centre focal points for prior appointment with list of students and faculty members. The centres organises visits, considering the safety and security protocols of the centres.</h3></p>
