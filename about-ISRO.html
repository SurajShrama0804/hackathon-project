    <h1>About ISRO</h1>
    <p>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of India. The organisation is involved in science, engineering and technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India and the mankind. ISRO is a major constituent of the Department of Space (DOS), Government of India. The department executes the Indian Space Programme primarily through various Centres or units within ISRO.

        ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), set up by the Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969 and superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology. DOS was set up and ISRO was brought under DOS in 1972.
        
        The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application of space technology for various national needs. To fulfil this objective, ISRO has established major space systemsfor communication, television broadcasting and meteorological services; resources monitoring and management; space-based navigation services. ISRO has developed satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place the satellites in the required orbits.
        
        Alongside its technological advancement, ISRO contributes to science and science education in the country. Various dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing, astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with other scientific projects encourage and promote science education, apart from providing valuable data to the scientific community which in turn enriches science.
        
        ISRO has its headquarters in Bengaluru. Its activities are spread across various centres and units. Launch Vehicles are built at VikramSarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram; Satellites are designed and developed at U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengalure; Integration and launching of satellites and launch vehicles are carried out from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota; Development of liquid stages including cryogenic stage is carried out at Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala& Bengaluru; Sensors for Communication and Remote Sensing satellites and application aspects of the space technology are taken up at Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and Remote Sensing satellite data reception processing and dissemination is entrusted to National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad.
        
        The activities of ISRO are guided by its Chairman, who would also be the secretary of DOS and Chairman of Space commission – the apex body that formulates the policies and overseas the implementation of the Indian Space Programme.</p>
        <h1>Founder Of ISRO: DR.Vikram Sarabhai </h1>
        <center><img src="https://th.bing.com/th?id=OIP.PF-pcOp0UiQmRNMO9ZEH5wHaEK&w=333&h=187&c=8&rs=1&qlt=90&o=6&dpr=1.3&pid=3.1&rm=2" alt="" width="300p0x"></center>
        <p><b>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, often hailed as the father of the Indian space program, was a visionary scientist, a remarkable innovator, and a dedicated patriot. His life, though relatively short, was a testament to relentless ambition, intellectual curiosity, and a profound commitment to advancing India's scientific prowess.</b></p>
        <h2>Early Life and Education:</h2>
<p><b>Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was born on August 12, 1919, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, into a prominent and affluent family. His father, Ambalal Sarabhai, was a successful industrialist and philanthropist, while his mother, Sarla Devi, was known for her progressive values and social work. Raised in a household that was visited by prominent leaders and intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, Vikram was exposed to the value of education, philanthropy, and a strong moral ethos from an early age.</b></p>
<p><b>Vikram’s early education was largely at home in Ahmedabad, where he attended the Gujarat College. He later moved to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, where he pursued a degree in natural sciences. However, his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, prompting him to return to India. In 1942, while in India, he met Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, a leading nuclear physicist, with whom he would later collaborate extensively in building India’s scientific landscape. Following the war, Sarabhai returned to Cambridge to complete his doctorate in cosmic rays in 1947.</b></p>
<h2>The Establishment of PRL and Early Research:</h2>
<p><b>After returning to India with a Ph.D., Sarabhai was determined to pursue research in cosmic rays, a relatively new and challenging field. In 1947, he established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, which would become one of India's leading research institutions. PRL focused on understanding fundamental physics, particularly cosmic rays, atmospheric sciences, and space physics. Sarabhai was a strong believer in using science and technology for the nation’s development, and he dedicated himself to fostering an environment where Indian scientists could thrive.</b></p>
<h2><b><u>The Birth of the Indian Space Program</u>:</b></h2>
<p><b>Sarabhai's most significant contribution came in 1962 when he convinced the Indian government to establish the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which later evolved into the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At that time, the world was captivated by the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Sarabhai had a bold vision: that space technology could serve the socio-economic needs of India and help solve problems like education, agriculture, and communication, despite India's limited resources.</b></p>
<p><b>He famously stated
“There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To us, there is no ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight. But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society.”</b></p>
<p><b>In 1963, under his guidance, India launched its first-ever sounding rocket from Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Kerala, marking the beginning of India’s journey in space. The launch was modest, with rockets and equipment transported by bicycles and bullock carts, symbolizing the resourcefulness of India’s nascent space program.</b></p>
<h2><b><u>Collaboration with NASA and the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)</u>:</b></h2>
<p><b>Sarabhai’s vision was not just about launching rockets; he envisioned using space technology to address practical challenges on Earth. One of his most ambitious projects was the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE), conducted in partnership with NASA in 1975-76. This project, carried out posthumously after Sarabhai’s death, aimed to bring educational programs to over 2,400 remote Indian villages via satellite transmission, marking one of the earliest large-scale experiments in satellite-based rural education.</b></p>
<p><b>SITE</b> demonstrated the transformative potential of satellites for education, healthcare, and disaster management in rural India, validating Sarabhai’s belief in space technology as a catalyst for development.</p>
<h1><b><u>Establishing a Legacy: Founding of IIM Ahmedabad and Other Institutions</u>:</b></h1>
<p><b>In addition to his work in space science, Sarabhai made significant contributions to other areas of science, education, and industry in India. He was instrumental in founding the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad in 1961, in collaboration with the government of India and the Harvard Business School. He wanted to cultivate a culture of professional management in India, and IIM Ahmedabad has since become one of the premier business schools in Asia.</b></p>

<h3>Sarabhai also founded and supported several other institutions, including:

ATIRA (Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association) – to modernize the textile industry.
CEERI (Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute).
ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization).
PRL (Physical Research Laboratory).
Space Applications Centre (SAC) – a center focused on applications of space technology for communication, meteorology, and remote sensing.
<h1><u>Personal Life</u>:</h1>
In 1942, Sarabhai married the renowned classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai. Together, they had two children, Mallika Sarabhai, a prominent dancer and activist, and Kartikeya Sarabhai, an environmentalist. Despite his busy professional life, Sarabhai was a loving family man, known for his humility and warmth. He maintained a balanced approach to life, often finding solace in his family and the arts.</h3>
<h2><u>Sudden Demise and Legacy</u>:</h2>
<p><b>On December 30, 1971, at the age of 52, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai passed away unexpectedly in his sleep at the Halcyon Castle, Kovalam, in Kerala. His death left a huge void in Indian science, but his vision continued to inspire generations of scientists, space enthusiasts, and policymakers.</b></p>
<p><b>Sarabhai’s legacy lives on through ISRO, which has achieved remarkable milestones, including the Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan missions and a reputation as one of the world’s leading space agencies, particularly for cost-effective space exploration. In recognition of his contributions, ISRO’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thiruvananthapuram was named in his honor. Furthermore, Vikram lander in India’s recent Chandrayaan missions is named after him, symbolizing the legacy of his spirit in India's ongoing exploration of space.</b></p>
<h2><u>Vision and Philosophy</u>:</h2>
<p><b>Dr. Sarabhai was not only a scientist but a visionary who saw science and technology as tools for national development and social equity. His philosophy was that technology should be harnessed to solve societal challenges, especially in a country as diverse and complex as India. His vision shaped the course of India’s space program and laid the groundwork for using satellite technology for practical applications such as weather forecasting, disaster management, education, and agriculture.</b></P>
<p><b>Sarabhai's pioneering mindset, adaptability, and drive to contribute to society's development through science have made him a revered figure in India and a global icon of space science. His approach has set a model for developing countries on how scientific advancement can complement socioeconomic growth and self-reliance.</b></p>
<h2><u>Conclusion</u>:</h2>
<p><b>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai's life story is one of purpose, foresight, and dedication to humanity. His dream of using space science as a means to improve the lives of Indians has not only been realized but continues to expand with each new achievement of ISRO.
