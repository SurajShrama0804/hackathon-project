                    The activities of ISRO are guided by its Chairman, who would also be the secretary of DOS and Chairman of Space commission – the apex body that formulates the policies and overseas the implementation of the Indian Space Programme.</p>
                    <h1>Founder Of ISRO: DR.Vikram Sarabhai </h1>
                    <p><b>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, often hailed as the father of the Indian space program, was a visionary scientist, a remarkable innovator, and a dedicated patriot. His life, though relatively short, was a testament to relentless ambition, intellectual curiosity, and a profound commitment to advancing India's scientific prowess.</b></p>
                    <h2>Early Life and Education:</h2>
            <p><b>Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was born on August 12, 1919, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, into a prominent and affluent family. His father, Ambalal Sarabhai, was a successful industrialist and philanthropist, while his mother, Sarla Devi, was known for her progressive values and social work. Raised in a household that was visited by prominent leaders and intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, Vikram was exposed to the value of education, philanthropy, and a strong moral ethos from an early age.</b></p>
            <p><b>Vikram’s early education was largely at home in Ahmedabad, where he attended the Gujarat College. He later moved to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, where he pursued a degree in natural sciences. However, his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, prompting him to return to India. In 1942, while in India, he met Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, a leading nuclear physicist, with whom he would later collaborate extensively in building India’s scientific landscape. Following the war, Sarabhai returned to Cambridge to complete his doctorate in cosmic rays in 1947.</b></p>
            <h2>The Establishment of PRL and Early Research:</h2>
            <p><b>After returning to India with a Ph.D., Sarabhai was determined to pursue research in cosmic rays, a relatively new and challenging field. In 1947, he established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, which would become one of India's leading research institutions. PRL focused on understanding fundamental physics, particularly cosmic rays, atmospheric sciences, and space physics. Sarabhai was a strong believer in using science and technology for the nation’s development, and he dedicated himself to fostering an environment where Indian scientists could thrive.</b></p>
